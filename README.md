# Alpha!

Hello everybody,

I, James Ehlmann, with the entire ForJ team, am proud to announce that the Fantasy World Manager is officially in alpha!

For the time being it can be downloaded here: http://138.47.200.245/jehlmann/fwm/blob/master/FWM-alpha.zip

Remember, this is an alpha, so things are not entirely finished. With that in mind, if you have any ideas or changes that you would like, talk to me. I would love to hear your thoughts.

Happy Dungeon Mastering,

James Ehlmann

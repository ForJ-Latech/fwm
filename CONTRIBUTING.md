# Contributing

We need more contributors if this project is going to succeed. Therefore if you want to contribute please let us know. 

## I noticed a bug, what now?
1. Open up a detailed issue with: 
	
	1. repeatable steps: create a new npc (with ctrl + n), name it "stan", save npc, app crashes 
	2. the build date: fwm-THIS_NUMBER.jar
	3. and what desktop environment you are running on: Windows 10
	
2. Wait, it could up to a week for a response from a developer. 

3. If you waited long enough try hopping into the discord, and posting a message there, most developers check that discord once a day. 


## I want to fix an issue 

1. Open a pull request, and title it what you are trying to fix. It will probably be approved. 


## I want to help expand the software

1. The project is pretty small, just PM james-ehlmann on github

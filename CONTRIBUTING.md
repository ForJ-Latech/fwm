# Contributing

We need more contributors if this project is going to succeed. Therefore if you want to contribute please let us know. 

## I noticed a bug, what now?
You should open up a detailed issue on github containing: 
  * repeatable steps e.g. create a new npc (with ctrl + n), name it "stan", save npc, app crashes 
  * the build date e.g. fwm-THIS\_NUMBER.jar
  * and what desktop environment you are running on e.g. Windows 10
	
Then you'll have to wait, because it could up to a week for a response from a developer. After you've waited long enough try hopping into the discord (if there is no noticeable change), and posting a message there, most developers check that discord once a day. 


## I want to fix an issue 

1. Open a pull request, and title it what you are trying to fix. Then fix it. 


## I want to help expand the software

1. This project is still small, just PM james-ehlmann on github

2. After PM-ing james-ehlmann, remind him that a setup guide for developing is a necessary addition to the software.
